*   **Data driven careers**
    
    - **Profiles and functions**:

        - Data Scientist, Analyst.

        Gather, clean, analyze, and share insights from data with stakeholders. Create insights that inform various tasks like guide decision-making, identify user preferences, or determine how to use resources more effectively. With more industries looking for data professionals, there is a great chance that you will find one that matches your interests.
Uncover trends, patterns, and insights from data. Employ advanced modeling and statistical analytics techniques
        
        - Data Managment and infrastructure

        responsible for the systems that distribute data and maintain its integrity.

        - Bussiness intelligence

        - Product Development tools

        - Chiefs Data related

    - **Ethical Considerations**:
        
        - Privacy, Data anonymization, Data aggregation, 
        
        - Personal identifiable info (PII)

        - Bias, Credibility, Ethics, Access.

        * **Be cautious of unintentional harm**

        Many of the decisions make have the potential to impact people across a broad range of social and economic factors. Strive to produce information that is accurate, while respecting cultural and social norms. 

        Respect and follow company’s policies. When presented with challenges, it is best to seek guidance from leadership within your organization on how to navigate. 
Avoid creating or reinforcing bias and consider inclusivity

        Uphold high standards of scientific excellence.
The processes and technology that you will interact with as a data analytics professional are deeply rooted in the scientific method. Embrace inquiry, intellectual discussion, and collaboration. Invite feedback and assess feedback. Remember, artificial intelligence still depends on data professionals. The more time and consideration that goes into the process of data analytics, the better the results.
Different industries have different standards. 

*   **Skills**

    - Coachable, Interpersonal skills like communicating and building relationships. Life long learning.



*   **Work flow**

    - **PACE**

        - **Plan**:

        Establish a solid foundation for success.  
        Define the scope of your project.  
        Identify the informational needs of the organization. 
        Wide view.

        • Research business data
        
        • Define the project scope
        
        • Develop a workflow
        
        • Assess project and/or stakeholder needs

        When we are acquiring a new skills, much of the time will be classified in the PACE planning stage. 

        - **Analyze**

        In the analyzing stage, Interact with the data for the first time. 
        Here you will acquire all of the data you will need for the project. 
        Some datasets could come from primary sources within your organization. 
        Others may need to be collected from secondary sources outside your company. 
        You may even find that you need governmental or open source data. 
The analyzing stage is also where you will engage in exploratory data analysis.
        This involves cleaning, reorganizing and analyzing all of the necessary data for the project.
            • Format database
            • Scrub data
            • Convert data into usable formats
            • Methodical examination of the data is conducted. 
       
		 - **Construct**
        
        In this stage of PACE, you will be building, interpreting, and revising models. 
        Some projects will require machine learning algorithms to uncover correlations within your data. 
        You will use these correlations to uncover information from the data that would otherwise go unused. 
        These relationships can help your organization make informed decisions about the future.
            • Select modeling approach
            • Build models
            • Build machine learning algorithms

        - **Execute** 
        
        In the execution stage, you will put your analysis and construction into action. Deliver findings to the internal and external stakeholders. 
Quite often, this will involve stakeholders from the business-side of the companies you are working with. 
Presenting your findings is only a part of the execution stage. 
Stakeholders will provide feedback, ask questions, and make recommendations that you will collect and incorporate.

*   **Communication**

Regardless of where you might be within the PACE workflow, communication is essential to moving the framework through to the realization of the project. One way to think of this is by visualizing the four stages of PACE as a completed circuit and with communication being represented by the flow of electricity. At each stage, there will always be a need for communication to improve the workflow. This could be asking questions about your data, gathering additional sources, updating stakeholders on progress, or presenting findings and receiving feedback.

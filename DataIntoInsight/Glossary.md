Data that was gathered from inside your own organization

# G

**Global outliers:** 

Values that are completely different from the overall data group and have no association with any other outliers

**Grouping:** 

The process of aggregating individual observations of a variable into groups

# H
**Heatmap:** 

A type of data visualization that depicts the magnitude of an instance or set of values based on two colors

**Histogram:** 

A data visualization that depicts an approximate representation of the distribution of values in a dataset

# I

**Info():** 

Gives the total number of entries, along with the data types—called Dtypes in pandas—of the individual entries

Data transformation technique where each category is assigned a unique number instead of a qualitative value

# M

**Measures:** 

Numeric values that can be aggregated or placed in calculations

**Merging:** 

A method to combine two (or more) different data frames along a specified starting column(s)

**Missing data:** 

A data value that is not stored for a variable in the observation of interest

# N

**Non-null count:** 

The total number of data entries for a data column that are not blank 

# O
